The first time you run the server, you will need to apply migrations: `python manage.py migrate`

To put test users in the database, use `python manage.py dbshell` to get an interactive shell in the current database. If you don't have the CLI application on the path, you can use `python manage.py shell` and interact with the ORM through Django's API.
To create a simple test account, run `python manage.py shell --command="from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model; get_user_model().objects.create_user(first_name='random', last_name='person', username='test', password='password', email='random@aracroproducts.com')"`

To run the development server, run `python manage.py runserver`. See the [Django Docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/) for more information
